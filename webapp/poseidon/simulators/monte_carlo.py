"""
The simulation infrastructure for the project. Uses a road network, a road damage model (bernoulli) and a disaster
model to produces realizations of that particular disaster, then calculates the list of metrics that were provided
on each instance. Then it calculates the average metric value for each node over all the simulations, giving us a
stochastic approximation of the metric for that city in the aftermath of the given disaster.
